### Hi there ! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

<!-- Message daccueil et de presentation.--> 
I am Baptiste. I 'm a student in Hive. Since a year, I have started learning code and particularly C.

### What is Hive ?
  [Hive](www.hive.fi/en/about-hive/) is a new kind of coding school in Helsinki sponsored by Supercell, based on the revolutionary education model of the French school [Ecole 42](https://42.fr/).

###                                                                                                   Profile
 I'm a social and driven professional making a career change from tourism team management to software development, I have been studying full-time in HIVE Helsinki since 2021 and prior to that I have been self-studying and taking courses on several coding languages out of personal interest and passion for 2 years. I'm an absolute team player and work very well in peer-to-peer environments as with independent projects and tickets.
 
Coding in C | Peer-to-peer coding | Problem-solving mindset | Efficiancy | Proactif | Positive | Team player | Learning mindset

### Working at the moment on

  - [Corewar]: This project involves creating a virtual arena, and having simplistic-language programs fight each other. You will get acquainted with VM conception (with the instructions it recognizes, the registers, etc.) and compilation problems of an assembly language in bytecode. In bonus, youâ€™ll have the pleasure of having your champions fight in the arena.


### My 42 projects
  - [Baseccamp](https://github.com/B9R9/42-Hive-Basecamp): My basecamp experience
  - [Libft](https://github.com/B9R9/42-Hive-Libft): A complete and continuously updated user-made C library, with extensions beyond the standard library
  - [Fillit](https://github.com/B9R9/42-Hive-Fillit): Searching the optimal fit of Tetriminos in the smallest square possible, in a time efficient manner
  - [Init](https://github.com/B9R9/42-Hive-Init): From the Networking branch, An introduction of network and system administration
  - [Arena](https://github.com/B9R9/42-Hive-Arena): A IA for a small game 
  - [Ftprintf](https://github.com/B9R9/42-Hive-ft_printf): Rebuilt your own version of the function printf
  - [Roger-Skyile-1](https://github.com/B9R9/42-Hive-Roger-Skyline-1): Roger-skyline-1 let you install a Virtual Machine, discover the basics about system and network administration as well as a lots of services used on a server machine.
  - [Filler](https://github.com/B9R9/42-Hive-Filler): Create your player program to compete against other students on the famous (or not) Filler board. The principle is simple: two players take on each other on a board, and take turns placing the piece that the master of the game (supplied in the form of a Ruby executable) gives them, earning points.
  - [Lem-in]: This project is meant to make you code an ant farm manager.

### My personal projects
  - [Ceasar Method](https://github.com/B9R9/42-Hive-cypher): A program that encrypts and decrypts a message following the ceasar method
  - [Useful Script](https://github.com/B9R9/42-Hive-script): Scripts who make my life a better place.
  - [Guess my Number](https://github.com/B9R9/Guest-My-Number): A small C game.
